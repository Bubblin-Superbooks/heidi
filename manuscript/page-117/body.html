"You have come to Frankfurt to stay with me, don't you know that? We shall have our lessons together, and I think it will be great fun when you learn to read. Generally the morning seems to have no end, for Mr. Candidate comes at ten and stays till two. That is a long time, and he has to yawn himself, he gets so tired. Miss Rottenmeier and he both yawn together behind their books, but when I do it, Miss Rottenmeier makes me take cod-liver oil and says  that I am ill. So I must swallow my yawns, for I hate the oil. What fun it will be now, when you learn to read!"</p><p>Heidi shook her head doubtfully at these prospects.</p></div> </div>
