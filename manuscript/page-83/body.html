Near a table a woman was seated, busy with mending Peter's coat, which Heidi had recognized immediately. A bent old woman was sitting in a corner, and Heidi, approaching her at once, said: "How do you do, grandmother? I have come now, and I hope I haven't kept you waiting too long!"</p><p>Lifting her head, the grandmother sought for Heidi's hand. Feeling it thoughtfully, she said: "Are you the little girl who lives up with the uncle? Is your name Heidi?"</p><p>"Yes," Heidi replied. "The grandfather just brought me down in the sled."</p><p>"How is it possible? Your hands are as warm as toast! Brigida, did the uncle really come down with the child?"</p></div> </div>
