You used to stay away from school, sometimes more than a week, and lately you have not even missed a day. Who has brought about this change?"</p><p>"The uncle."</p><p>Every evening now Peter on his return home read one song to his grandmother, but never more. To the frequent praises of Brigida, the old woman once replied: "I am glad he has learnt something, but nevertheless I am longing for the spring to come. Then Heidi can visit me, for when she reads, the verses sound so different. I cannot always follow Peter, and the songs don't thrill me the way they do when Heidi says them!"</p><p>And no wonder! For Peter would often leave out long and difficult words,â€”what did three or four words matter! So it happened sometimes that there were hardly any nouns left in the hymns that Peter read.</p></div> </div>
