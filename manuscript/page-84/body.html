I think she looks like both of them."</p><p>While the women were talking, Heidi had  been taking in everything. Then she said: "Grandmother, look at the shutter over there. It is hanging loose. If grandfather were here, he would fasten it. It will break the window-pane! Just look at it."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"What a sweet child you are," said the grandmother</p></div> </div>
