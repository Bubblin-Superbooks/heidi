Heidi had remembered her grandfather's words to Deta about her feather hat; that was why she had kept her old hat so carefully. Brigida at last accepted the gift after a great many remonstrances. Suddenly Heidi took off her pretty dress and tied her old shawl about her. Taking the grandmother's hand, she said: "Good-bye, I must go home to grandfather now, but I shall come again tomorrow. Good-night, grandmother."</p><p>"Oh, please come again to-morrow, Heidi," implored the old woman, while she held her fast.</p><p>"Why did you take your pretty dress off?" asked Brigida.</p></div> </div>
