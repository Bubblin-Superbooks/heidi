Why are you so sure?"</p><p>"Because I have prayed for the same thing many, many weeks and God has not done what I have asked Him to."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"That is not the way, Heidi. You see, God in heaven is a good Father to all of us, who knows what we need better than we do. When something we ask for is not very good for us, He gives us something much better, if we confide in Him and do not lose confidence in His love. I am sure what you asked for was not very good for you just now; He has heard you, for He can hear the prayers of all the people in the world at the same time,</p></div> </div>
