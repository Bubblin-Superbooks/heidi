The grandfather put the thick cover on the bed while  Heidi watched him. After it was all done, she said: "What a nice bed I have now, and what a splendid cover! I only wish the evening was here, that I might go to sleep in it."</p><p>"I think we might eat something first," said the grandfather. "Don't you think so?"</p></div> </div>
