But she knew that her father did not like to see her cry, and besides she was sure that her papa would only forbid her this pleasure because it was absolutely necessary to do so.</p><p>So she bravely fought her tears, and caressing the doctor's hand, said:</p><p>"Oh please, doctor, do go to Heidi; then you can tell me all about her, and can describe her grandfather to me, and Peter, with his goats,â€”I seem to know them all so well. Then you can take all the things to her that I had planned to take myself.
