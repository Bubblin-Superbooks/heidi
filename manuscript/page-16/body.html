<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">In the new translation of "Heidi" here offered to the public I believe that most readers will notice an especial flavor, that very quality of delight in mountain scenes, in mountain people and in child life generally, which is one of the chief merits of the German original. The phrasing has also been carefully adapted to the purpose of reading aloudâ€”a thing that few translators think of. In conclusion, the author, realising the  difference between the two languages, has endeavored to write the story afresh, as Johanna Spyri would have written it had English been her native tongue. How successful the attempt has been the reader will judge.</p><p>- Charles Wharton Stork</p><p><em>Assistant Professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania.</em></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
