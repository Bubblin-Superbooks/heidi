Rosy clouds were passing overhead, but gradually the sky grew more blue and deep, and soon a golden light passed over the heights, for the sun was rising in all his glory.</p><p>"Oh, how lovely! Good-morning, grandfather," Heidi exclaimed.</p><p>"Are your eyes bright already?" the grandfather retorted, holding out his hand.</p><p>Heidi then ran over to her beloved fir-trees and danced about, while the wind was howling in the branches.</p><p>After the old man had washed and milked the goats, he brought them out of the shed. When Heidi saw her friends again, she caressed them tenderly, and they in their turn nearly crushed her between them. Sometimes when Bärli got too wild, Heidi would say: "But Bärli, you push me like the Big Turk," and that was enough to quiet the goat.</p></div> </div>
