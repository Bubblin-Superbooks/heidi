<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">sheet."</p><p>"Is that so?" said the old man. After a while he opened the cupboard and rummaged around in it. At last he pulled out a long coarse cloth from under the shirts. It somewhat resembled a sheet, and with this he climbed up to the loft. Here a neat little bed was already prepared. On top the hay was heaped up high so that the head of the occupant would lie exactly opposite the window.</p><p>The grandfather was well pleased with the arrangement. To prevent the hard floor from being felt, he made the couch twice as  thick. Then he and Heidi together put the heavy sheet on, tucking the ends in well. Heidi looked thoughtfully at her fresh, new bed and said, "Grandfather, we have forgotten something."</p><p>"What?" he asked.</p><p>"I have no cover. When I go to bed I always creep in between the sheet and the cover."</p></div> </div>
